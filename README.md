# Antilock_breaking_system
Project for an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) using LoRa communication, Jetson Nano, and IoT

Hardware Setup:

Jetson Nano Developer Kit.
ABS hardware components (sensors, actuators, brake controller).
LoRa modules for wireless communication.
Appropriate power supply and wiring.
Software Components:

Jetson Nano development environment.
Python for programming Jetson Nano.
LoRa communication library (e.g., PyLoRa).
IoT platform for data monitoring and control (e.g., AWS IoT, Azure IoT, or a custom solution).
Code Overview:

 Jetson Nano Code (Python):

Interface with ABS sensors (e.g., wheel speed sensors) and actuators (e.g., brake controller).
Implement ABS control algorithm to prevent wheel lock during heavy braking.
Use LoRa communication to transmit ABS control commands and data to the vehicle's brake controller.

LoRa Communication Code (Python with PyLoRa):

Use PyLoRa or a similar library to set up LoRa communication between the Jetson Nano and the vehicle's brake controller.
Send and receive ABS control commands and data.

IoT Integration:

Set up an IoT platform (e.g., AWS IoT Core) to collect data from the Jetson Nano and monitor/control the ABS system remotely.
Configure IoT rules and actions to trigger alerts or actions based on ABS data.
